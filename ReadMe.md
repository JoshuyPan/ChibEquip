Keeping it in the field of chibs: 

Have a chib, the chib should have an armour section which should allow for 4 nft armour pieces to be attached to it. 

Chib -> armour equiped -> armour pieces such as helmet, torso, pants and boots. 

So an object (chib) that hold another object (armour set) which holds for objects (armour pieces.)
